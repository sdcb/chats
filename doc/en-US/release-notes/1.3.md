### 3) File Management

New file management support, laying the foundation for future document processing and multimodal features:
- File upload, storage, and management
- File access control
- Preparation for document analysis features in future releases

### 4) Image Processing Optimizations

- **Parallel Downloads**: Support parallel downloading of multiple generated images, significantly improving user experience
- **Default Parameter Optimization**: Unified default image count to 1 for both generation and editing to avoid accidental multiple image generation
- **Filename Optimization**: Automatically extract meaningful filenames from image links for easier management
